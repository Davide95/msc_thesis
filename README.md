# MSc thesis
This repo contains the code used in my MSc thesis "Learning relational models from networked data on the web".

Everything was done under the supervision of [@annalisabarla](https://github.com/annalisabarla), [@nicolettanoceti](https://github.com/nicolettanoceti) and [@DaviGarba](https://github.com/DaviGarba).
