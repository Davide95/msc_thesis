# MSc thesis
This repo contains the code used in my MSc thesis "A comparison study between topic modelling techniques and clustering on graphs".

Everything was done under the supervision of [@annalisabarla](https://github.com/annalisabarla), [@nicolettanoceti](https://github.com/nicolettanoceti) and [@DaviGarba](https://github.com/DaviGarba).
