# MSc thesis
This repo contains the code used in my MSc thesis ["Learning relational models from networked data on the web"](https://unire.unige.it/handle/123456789/3219).

Everything was done under the supervision of [@annalisabarla](https://github.com/annalisabarla), [@nicolettanoceti](https://github.com/nicolettanoceti) and [@DaviGarba](https://github.com/DaviGarba).
